"""
Facet segmentation: research question -> ordered PICO-style facets, each a
(name, role, token span) over the question text. NOT a port of anything in
the upstream sensein/search-strategy-generator project -- that tool asks a
model to select vocabulary IDs from a candidate slate (a high-entropy
decision: "which of these 40 headings matter"). This module asks a model for
the lowest-entropy thing it can be asked for instead: WHERE in the sentence
each concept lives. Vocabulary selection happens afterwards in closure.py, as
a pure function of the span and the local MeSH index -- the model never sees
MeSH at all, so it cannot hallucinate a heading or pick between synonyms.

Reproducibility strategy: self-consistency voting (Wang et al. 2022,
"Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning", applied here to span
segmentation rather than reasoning chains). Instead of trusting one sample,
draw k independent completions of the same low-entropy task and keep only
spans a majority of the k runs agree on. Because segmentation is already a
lower-entropy task than vocabulary generation, and disagreement gets voted
away instead of silently compiled into the query, agreement should be higher
than single-shot free-text proposal by construction -- measured, not just
claimed, in eval/eval_closure.py.

`heuristic_facets` is a zero-network, 100%-deterministic fallback (used when
no LLM key is configured, or all k LLM samples fail) so this pipeline always
has a model-independent path, the same property mesh_only gives the upstream
tool -- built independently here via simple conjunction/punctuation chunking
rather than MeSH span-matching.

Sync (`segment`, used by the eval harness and any script) and async
(`segment_async`, used by FastAPI so the event loop isn't blocked) entry
points share every piece of logic below the HTTP call itself via
`_parse_facet_response` and `_vote_or_fallback` -- only the request
transport differs (`requests` vs `httpx`).
